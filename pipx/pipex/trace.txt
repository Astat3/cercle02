BREAKING TEST CASE FOUND
========================

Command that broke the code:
./pipex test_input.txt "/bin/cat" "wc -l" output_abs.txt

Shell equivalent:
< test_input.txt /bin/cat | wc -l

PIPEX OUTPUT:
Command not found: No such file or directory
       0

SHELL OUTPUT:
       1

EXPLANATION:
The pipex program fails to handle absolute path commands (like /bin/cat).
The find_var() function only searches in PATH directories and doesn't check
if the command itself is already an absolute path that exists.

When the shell executes "< test_input.txt /bin/cat | wc -l", it correctly
uses /bin/cat as an absolute path and outputs "1" (one line counted).

When pipex executes the same command, it tries to find "/bin/cat" in the
PATH directories instead of checking if it's already a valid absolute path,
resulting in "Command not found" error and incorrect output of "0".

This breaks the requirement to reproduce the behavior of the pipe in terminal.
